My deep exploration of software engineering began with an entrepreneurial experience during my time at university.==During the development of Xplorer, a campus application serving over 7,000 users, our team encountered significant challenges due to the absence of a robust architectural design. These challenges included the blurring of service boundaries, which evolved into a ‘god class,’ leading to circular dependencies. These issues made the project difficult to maintain and severely hindered delivery efficiency.== These painful experiences made me realise that the problem was not a lack of ‘enforcement,’ but rather a lack of a top-down engineering methodology and architectural constraints. By my third year of university, Kiro and other new-generation AI development tools allowed me to experience the powerful capabilities of AI under strict architectural constraints. ==Following Kiro's guidelines, which stipulate that humans should first design the architecture and specify the delivery documents, and then AI should fill in the details, I independently completed an accounting application in four days that would have previously taken a team several weeks to complete.== The stark contrast between these two experiences has made me keenly aware that, in the AI era, the core value of software engineers will increasingly lie in their ability to engage in top-level design. Software engineers must become the ‘conductors’ who can plan highly available architectures and define engineering blueprints, so that AI can become reliable ‘performers.’ In order to systematically master this ‘command’ ability and ensure my competitiveness in the AI era, I urgently need to achieve a double breakthrough during my postgraduate studies: first, to build rigorous and scientific software architecture design capabilities; second, to master cutting-edge and efficient software project management methodologies. The Master of Software Engineering programme at the National University of Singapore is the ideal platform for me to achieve this breakthrough in capability.

My systematic understanding of software architecture design began with the undergraduate course ‘Software Architecture and Development Environment.’ This course not only revealed cutting-edge architectural styles such as microservices and event-driven architecture, but more importantly, it laid the foundation for my use of the visual modelling language UML. Through systematic study of the methodology of defining requirement boundaries using use case diagrams, constructing static structures using class diagrams, and depicting dynamic behaviour using sequence diagrams and state diagrams, I have gained a theoretical framework for understanding complex systems. ==During my internship at Ant Group, I experienced firsthand the power of engineering blueprints. A clear UML sequence diagram depicting payment routing, risk control, and account processing instantly deconstructed the complex business code that had previously baffled me, giving me a deep understanding of the irreplaceable value of an excellent documentation system.==More importantly, I found that this system is also the cornerstone of efficient collaboration with AI. During development, I use product requirement documents, technical specification documents, and API specifications as contextual input for the company's AI IDE tool. After that, I can obtain a comprehensive and accurate technical overview by asking for implementation details of a specific interface or having it perform a broad query of related dependencies based on the context. This has significantly improved my code quality and delivery speed, and has made me deeply realise a core fact: in the AI era, the value of human engineers is being reflected more than ever in their top-level design capabilities for creating and interpreting complex engineering blueprints.

My experience participating in the backend development of the TNGD wallet at Ant Group has given me a deep understanding that a well-designed architectural framework is crucial to ensuring that AI ‘writes good’ code. ==In Ant Group's development practice, I came across a service layer design based on the Template Method Pattern.It encapsulates underlying mechanisms such as transactions and logging through an abstract template class. Developers only need to override the core `execute` method to fill in the business logic.This immediately reminded me of Kiro's development philosophy. Ant's framework naturally breaks down a large development task into small, single-purpose ‘subtasks’ that Kiro needs.==Ant's design paradigm provides a ‘strongly-constrained sandbox’ for AI-assisted development. The task of AI is no longer to build business processes in an open-ended manner, but to focus on producing results within the clear boundaries of this ‘fill-in-the-blank’ framework. ==So, I began to consciously apply AI programming assistants to this ‘strongly constrained sandbox.’The results confirmed my hypothesis: when the execution boundaries are strictly constrained by the framework, the probability of AI errors is significantly reduced, and its code generation potential is safely and efficiently unleashed.This has convinced me that, in the future of human-machine collaboration, the core value of software architecture lies in its ‘guidance’ and ‘constraint’ capabilities. ==

Therefore, I am eager to delve deeper into software modelling and design patterns during my postgraduate studies to explore how to build software systems that adapt to and maximise AI collaboration efficiency.

AI-native development tools such as Claude Code and Cursor are unleashing personal productivity in unprecedented ways, heralding the dawn of an era where everyone is a product manager. ==I firmly believe that in this wave of change, the core value of software engineers is shifting from being producers of code to becoming architects of human-machine collaboration. To meet this challenge and shape my future, I plan to join a top internet company after graduation, starting in a back-end development position to explore how to build a system framework that maximises AI collaboration efficiency while ensuring code security and maintainability.  Therefore, my short-term career goal is to become a technical expert who leads projects. By participating in the design and iteration of real-world complex systems, I can gain a deep understanding of industry-leading architectural paradigms and incorporate product thinking into my technical decisions. My mid-term goal is to grow from a pure technical executor into a promoter of innovative products, gaining experience in leading the entire process of initiating and developing auxiliary tools for developers. My long-term vision is to establish my own technology company to develop an intelligent development platform that can realise ‘Requirements as Reliable Delivery.’ Creators will only need to focus on product documentation and business logic, while the platform will automatically generate logically correct and secure back-end services.==

The Master of Course in Software Engineering programme at the National University of Singapore is a key opportunity for me to realise these aspirations. Core courses such as SWE5006: Designing Modern Software Systems and SWE5001: Architecting Scalable Systems will provide me with a theoretical foundation for systematically mastering architectural paradigms, design patterns, and quality attribute trade-offs. I am particularly excited about SWE5008: Architecting AI Systems, where I hope to learn how to design secure, explainable intelligent agents rather than allowing AI to become an uncontrollable ‘black box.’ ==These courses are highly aligned with my knowledge needs. What attracts me even more is the programme's strong emphasis on practical training, especially the five-month Capstone graduation project. I look forward to working with outstanding peers from diverse backgrounds on a real-world, complex business problem in the Capstone project. I eagerly anticipate gaining a unique perspective on cutting-edge software development practices through the dynamic and innovative platform of NUS-ISS.==
