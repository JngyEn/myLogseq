My deep exploration of software engineering began with an entrepreneurial experience during my time at university.==While developing Xplorer, a campus app serving 7,000+ users, our lack of top-level architecture resulted in some "god class" with circular dependencies, severely crippling project maintenance and delivery speed.== These painful experiences made me realise that the problem was not a lack of ‘enforcement,’ but rather a lack of a top-down engineering methodology and architectural constraints. By my third year of university, Kiro and other new-generation AI development tools allowed me to experience the powerful capabilities of AI under strict architectural constraints. ==Later, applying Kiro's "architecture-first, AI-driven" development model, I single-handedly built a complete accounting app in four days, achieving in days what previously took our team weeks.== The stark contrast between these two experiences has made me keenly aware that, in the AI era, the core value of software engineers will increasingly lie in their ability to engage in top-level design. Software engineers must become the ‘conductors’ who can plan highly available architectures and define engineering blueprints, so that AI can become reliable ‘performers.’ In order to systematically master this ‘core competency’ and ensure my core competitiveness in the age of artificial intelligence, I need to learn rigorous software architecture and efficient project management. The Master of Software Engineering programme at the National University of Singapore is the ideal platform for me to achieve this goal.

My systematic understanding of software architecture design began with the undergraduate course ‘Software Architecture and Development Environment.’ This course not only revealed cutting-edge architectural styles such as microservices and event-driven architecture, but more importantly, it laid the foundation for my use of the visual modelling language UML. Through systematic study of the methodology of defining requirement boundaries using use case diagrams, constructing static structures using class diagrams, and depicting dynamic behaviour using sequence diagrams and state diagrams, I have gained a theoretical framework for understanding complex systems. ==At Ant Group, I witnessed the power of engineering blueprints firsthand: a UML sequence diagram detailing payment routing and risk control instantly clarified complex business logic, demonstrating the immense value of a robust documentation system.==More importantly, I found that this system is also the cornerstone of efficient collaboration with AI. During development, I use product requirement documents, technical specification documents, and API specifications as contextual input for the company's AI IDE tool. After that, I can obtain a comprehensive and accurate technical overview by asking for implementation details of a specific interface or having it perform a broad query of related dependencies based on the context. This has significantly improved my code quality and delivery speed, and has made me deeply realise a core fact: in the AI era, the value of human engineers is being reflected more than ever in their top-level design capabilities for creating and interpreting complex engineering blueprints.

My experience participating in the backend development of the TNGD wallet at Ant Group has given me a deep understanding that a well-designed architectural framework is crucial to ensuring that AI ‘writes good’ code. ==In Ant Group, I encountered a service layer design using the Template Method Pattern. It encapsulates underlying mechanisms, allowing developers to focus solely on overriding the core `execute` method with business logic. This design inherently breaks down complex tasks into small, single-responsibility "subtasks," perfectly aligning with Kiro's development philosophy.==Ant's design paradigm provides a ‘strongly-constrained sandbox’ for AI-assisted development. The task of AI is no longer to build business processes in an open-ended manner, but to focus on producing results within the clear boundaries of this ‘fill-in-the-blank’ framework. ==Applying AI assistants within this "strongly-constrained sandbox" confirmed my hypothesis: a well-defined framework drastically reduces AI errors and safely unleashes its potential. This convinced me that the future value of software architecture lies in its ability to both guide and constrain AI. ==Therefore, I am eager to delve deeper into software modelling and design patterns during my postgraduate studies to explore how to build software systems that adapt to and maximise AI collaboration efficiency.

AI-native development tools such as Claude Code and Cursor are unleashing personal productivity in unprecedented ways, heralding the dawn of an era where everyone is a product manager. ==I believe the role of a software engineer is evolving from code producer to an architect of human-AI collaboration. To pioneer this shift, my immediate goal after graduation is to join a top internet company, where I will focus on building robust system frameworks that effectively leverage AI. My short-term goal is to master industry-leading architectures at a top tech firm by designing and iterating on complex systems. Mid-term, I will transition from engineer to innovator, leading the development of tools that empower other developers. Ultimately, my long-term vision is to launch my own company to create a platform that achieves "Requirements as Reliable Delivery"—transforming product documentation directly into secure, logically correct back-end services..==

The Master of Course in Software Engineering programme at the National University of Singapore is a key opportunity for me to realise these aspirations. Core courses such as SWE5006: Designing Modern Software Systems and SWE5001: Architecting Scalable Systems will provide me with a theoretical foundation for systematically mastering architectural paradigms, design patterns, and quality attribute trade-offs. I am particularly excited about SWE5008: Architecting AI Systems, where I hope to learn how to design secure, explainable intelligent agents rather than allowing AI to become an uncontrollable ‘black box.’ ==These courses are highly aligned with my knowledge needs. What attracts me even more is the programme's strong emphasis on practical training, especially the five-month Capstone graduation project. I look forward to working with outstanding peers from diverse backgrounds on a real-world, complex business problem in the Capstone project. I eagerly anticipate gaining a unique perspective on cutting-edge software development practices through the dynamic and innovative platform of NUS-ISS.==
