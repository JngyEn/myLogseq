After completing my undergraduate studies in Accounting at Xiamen University Malaysia, I recognised that the discipline is undergoing unprecedented reforms, especially after experiencing the power of generative AI and digital transformation in the industry, for instance the automated generation of financial notes via ERP systems, and the automatic 3-way matching of accounts payable through Robertic Process Automation (RPA). These changes are not only in technology, but also with the frequent updates to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Accountants are transforming from data aggregator, report generator, and compliance officer to rule enablers and intelligent system promoter and monitor. All these real-life observations make me clear that the single skill cultivated in traditional accounting education is no longer able to cope with the compound opportunities of the digital economy, and that there is an urgent demand for a two-fold breakthrough at the postgraduate level, namely, to build a systematic understanding of the global accounting standards and to master the underlying logic of the intelligent financial systems. The Master of Accountancy programme at the Chinese University of Hong Kong is the ideal platform for me to make this cognitive leap.

Awareness of the dynamic nature of the accounting standards system began with the school's Analysis of Financial Statements (AFS) course and the learning of ACCA Strategic Business Reporting (SBR). I came across a typical case during my SBR course study, when Xiaomi applied for listing in Hong Kong in 2018, because of the requirement to comply with IFRS9 and IAS32, Xiaomi accounted for its redeemable preference shares issued in previous years as financial liabilities and recognised the fair value variations of such financial liabilities in current profit and loss on the subsequent balance sheet date, resulting in its prospectus indicating a loss of RMB43.9 billion in 2017. If not measured by IFRS, Xiaomi earned RMB5.4 billion in 2017. The difference between the two is as high as RMB49.3 billion, of which only the convertible redeemable preference shares adjusted the profit as high as RMB54.1 billion. This recognition of loss, starkly misaligned with the company's operational performance, was purely driven by accounting rules. Such fundamental conflict between the lag inherent in standards and the dynamism of business underscores that accounting transcends the mechanical application of rules; it is a business governance system requiring continuous adaptation. Building on this insight, I aim to systematically construct an analytical framework linking 'business substance evolution' and 'accounting standard principles' during my postgraduate studies. By deconstructing the internal logic of institutional change, I will explore pathways for adaptive optimization of standards, cultivating the innovative capacity needed to bridge the gap between the rigidity of rules and the expression of economic substance.

An internship in Accounts Payable at Taikoo Engine Services (Xiamen) Ltd. confronted me with the deep-seated challenges of accounting digitalization. Due to 30% non-standard invoices, RPA automation achieved only 70% coverage, necessitating 30% manual intervention to ensure invoice upload completeness. To overcome this bottleneck, I spearheaded an initiative using Outlook macros to batch consolidate email attachments and redesigned the RPA logic for automatic classification. This reduced manual intervention to below 10%, but exposed a more fundamental issue: the fragmentation of data flow caused by information silos and mixed media (emails/scanned paper documents). Automating isolated processes (like RPA) proved insufficient for resolving efficiency bottlenecks; solutions must target the more foundational level of "data governance" and the earlier stage of "intelligent perception." The future requires integrating intelligent Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Machine Learning (ML) to empower systems to interpret non-standard invoices and ambiguous fields, converting unstructured data (scans, email text) into structured information in real-time, eliminating the need for manual intervention at the source. This experience fundamentally reshaped my understanding of accounting digitalization: its core lies not in technological accumulation, but in driving the transition of the finance function from "data movers" to "business intelligent architects." Consequently, I am eager to delve into system integration and intelligent decision-making models during my postgraduate studies to develop solutions for the substantive evolution of the financial value chain.

The global accounting profession is undergoing significant transformation, grappling with emerging concepts like data asset accounting. To navigate this changing landscape, I believe accountants must possess a dual mastery of accounting principles and technological tools. Future accountants must act as "translators," converting complex business language into compliant financial data while also bridging data and business needs, using financial language to interpret market dynamics. My short-term career goal is to work as a Finance Business Partner within a Big Four accounting firm or a multinational corporation. This role will allow me to enhance my technical accounting skills, understand enterprise digitalization improvement directions, and pursue professional certifications (ACCA, CPA). My medium-term objective is to lead multinational corporate accounting system upgrade projects and develop intelligent financial engines to tackle the challenges of automating labor-intensive processes and adapting accounting standards for emerging business models (e.g., multi-dimensional revenue allocation, cross-border virtual transactions). My long-term aspiration is to become a CFO, deploying autonomous AI agents to achieve end-to-end dynamic process closure for complex business operations, ultimately establishing a new generation of cognitively resilient financial decision-making architecture.

The CUHK Master of Accountancy programme represents a vital opportunity to realize these ambitions. I was fascinated by its philosophy of nurturing professionals who are well-versed in IFRS and have a solid grasp of emerging technologies in accounting. The programme's positioning of blending cutting-edge accounting standards with emerging data analytics is a perfect fit with my career vision of driving accounting intelligence in the digital era. Based on my career aspirations, I am particularly interested in the specialized courses offered by the Accounting Analytics Concentration. It not only equips me with practical capabilities to handle massive data, uncover business insights, and solve real-world accounting and financial challenges through courses like ACCT6141 Accounting Data Analytics and Business Intelligence which empowering me to leverage advanced analytical tools, but also deepens my understanding of financial reporting disparities across institutional environments (especially regarding IFRS application) via courses such as Comparative Financial Reporting. This dual approach provides me with a critical theoretical framework and global perspective to analyze complex economic consequences in international business and formulate cross-regional strategies. I am eager to integrate into the diverse community at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I anticipate growing through collaborative exchange and dialogue. Ultimately, I aspire to become a forward-thinking accounting professional capable of navigating the complexities of global industries with a visionary perspective.
