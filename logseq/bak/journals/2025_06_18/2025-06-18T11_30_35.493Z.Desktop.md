Memory fragmentation leads to ineffective use of memory resources and can adversely affect system efficiency, performance and stability. It shows in two different ways: internal fragmentation and external fragmentation.Internal fragmentation occurs when a memory allocator allocates a block of memory that is larger than the application or process actually requires. The extra space within the allocated block remains unused but inaccessible to other processes, which is effectively a “waste” from the allocator's point of view. This inefficiency is due to allocate memory in fixed-size blocks or that adhere strictly to alignment requirements. For example, if an application requests 10 bytes but, due to architectural constraints, the smallest allocatable unit is 16 bytes, then 6 bytes of the 16-byte block become internally fragmented. Modern hardware architectures have wider cache lines and fine-grained data structures. Internal fragmentation results in lower cache utilization, higher memory footprint for applications, and ultimately consumes more physical RAM than is actually needed.

External fragmentation occurs when the total amount of free memory available in a system is theoretically sufficient to satisfy requests forlarge memory blocks, but this free memory is not located in contiguous physical segments. This phenomenon usually occurs in dynamic memory allocation and deallocation mode. In this mode, memory blocks are freed and reallocated at different times and sizes. The main consequence of external fragmentation is that requests for large contiguous memory regions cannot be satisfied even if sufficient total memory exists. This may cause new processes to fail to allocate memory. It may force the system to use a compressed memory operation or terminate certain applications and reducing overall system throughput and reliability.
