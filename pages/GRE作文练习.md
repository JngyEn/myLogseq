		2. 立场
			1. 部分同意
			2. 鼓励好行为是对的，但是不能忽略坏行为，要进行相应的惩罚
		3. 文章框架
			1. 第一段：
				1. 部分同意，鼓励好行为是对的，但是坏行为也不能完全忽略。忽略坏行为会导致意识不到错误
			2. 第二段：
				1. 观点：我们应该鼓励好的行为
				2. 理由：对好的行为的鼓励会提供正反馈，让被教育者更倾向于去做这些好的行为
				3. 论据：政府总会奖励那些为国家做出突出贡献的人，从而营造积极的社会风向
				4. 总结：好的行为是值得被鼓励的
			3. 第三段：

				1. The topic of weather best way to teach is praise good actions and ignore bad actions is a complex and often contentious issue. Some people argue that teach with praise is better than criticize. While this view has some merit. I believe that criticism is also a important part of teach. A deeper look remind that we mush also consider that incorporate praise and criticism can make a best teach.
				2. **问题分析:**
					1. `weather` -> `whether` (拼写错误)
					2. `is praise good actions` -> `to praise good actions` (语法结构)
					3. `teach with praise is better than criticize` -> `teaching with praise is better than criticizing` (动词形式不一致)
					4. `While this view has some merit.` - 这是一个**句子片段 (Fragment)** ，是严重的语法错误。它不能独立成句。
					5. `a important` -> `an important` (冠词错误)
					6. `a important part of teach` -> `an important part of teaching` (词性错误, teach是动词, teaching是名词)
					7. `remind` -> `reveals` (用词不当), `mush` -> `must` (拼写错误)
					8. `incorporate praise and criticism can make a best teach` -> `incorporating both praise and criticism creates the best teaching method.` (语法结构和词性)
				3. 修改：
					1. The question of whether the best way to teach is to praise good actions while ignoring bad ones is a complex issue. Some people argue that teaching with praise is more effective than criticizing. **While this view has some merit, I believe that responding to negative actions is also an essential part of education.** A deeper look reveals that the most effective teaching incorporates both praise and correction.
			2. 第二段：91
				1. On the one hand, It is true that praise is a powerful method to guide people to good actions. This is because human is inborn like the feelings which can provide positive response to our brain such as praise from others. For example, the parents usually use candies as rewards to praise young child who are unable to talk when them do some good actions. Then the babies intend to do the same actions next time. This is suitable for adults too. Thus, in some cases, the original claim is valid.
				2. **问题分析:**
					1. `human is inborn like the feelings...` -> 这句话的结构和意思非常模糊。你想表达的是“人类天生喜欢积极的反馈”。
					2. `the parents` -> `parents` (泛指不需要the)
					3. `young child` -> `young children` (复数)
					4. `when them do` -> `when they do` (主格宾格错误)
					5. 你的**例子非常好！** 用“父母给糖果”这个具体场景，远比你计划中“政府奖励”要好得多，更具体，更有说服力。这是你这篇文章最大的亮点！
				3. 修改：
					1. On the one hand, it is true that praise is a powerful tool for encouraging positive actions. This is because humans are naturally motivated by positive reinforcement. **For example, parents often give candy to young children to reward good behavior.** This simple reward encourages the children to repeat the positive action in the future. This principle applies to adults as well; praise in the workplace, for instance, can boost morale and productivity. Thus, praising good actions is undoubtedly an effective teaching strategy.
			3. 第三段：73
				1. However, if we  ignore criticism due to the effective of praise, there will be incomplete for good teach. This is due to the fact that praise only boost actions but can not inhibit actions. To illustrate, when a man break the law but not punished. The people will consider that this actions is actually approved. Then no one will abide the law anymore. Therefore, it is obviously that bad actions should not ignored.
				2. **问题分析:**
					1. `the effective of praise` -> `the effectiveness of praise` (词性错误)
					2. `there will be incomplete for good teach` -> `teaching will be incomplete` (句子结构)
					3. `praise only boost actions but can not inhibit actions` -> `praise only boosts positive actions but cannot inhibit negative ones.` (主谓一致，用词更精确) **这句话的逻辑非常棒！是全文的核心论点。**
					4. `when a man break the law but not punished.` -> 又是**句子片段**。应改为 `if a person breaks the law and is not punished...`
					5. `The people will consider...` -> `Other people might consider...`
					6. `bad actions should not ignored.` -> `bad actions should not be ignored.` (被动语态错误)
				3. 修改：
					1. However, ignoring negative actions is a critical mistake. The reason is simple: **while praise can encourage good behavior, it cannot discourage bad behavior.** If negative actions are met with silence, the person being taught may not even realize they have made a mistake.** For instance, if a student cheats on an exam and receives no punishment, they might assume that cheating is acceptable.** This not only harms the student's own moral development but also undermines the fairness of the entire educational system. Therefore, addressing negative actions is necessary to establish clear boundaries and consequences.
			4. 第四段：51
				1. To conclusion, while I acknowledge that praise is significant for teach, it is also important to recognize the indispensable of criticism. Ultimately, the best approach is not choose between praise good actions and ignore bad actions, but to find a thoughtful balance. Praise all good actions and punish all bad actions.
				2. **问题分析:**
					1. `To conclusion` -> `In conclusion`
					2. `for teach` ->`for teaching`
					3. `the indispensable of criticism` -> `the indispensability of criticism` (词性)
					4. `is not choose between...` -> `is not to choose between...`
					5. `Praise all good actions and punish all bad actions.` -> 最后一句过于绝对和简单，可以稍微升华一下。
				3. 修改：
					1.  In conclusion, while I acknowledge that praise is a significant tool in teaching, it is equally important to address negative actions. The most effective educational approach is not to simply choose one method over the other, but to find a thoughtful balance. A good teacher, or a just society, knows when to offer encouragement for positive deeds and when to provide firm correction for negative ones.
